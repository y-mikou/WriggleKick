# Performance Comparison Report

## Overview
This report compares the processing speed between the baseline `develop` branch and the optimized branch with file caching improvements from `devin/1757737826-reduce-duplicate-reads`.

## Test Environment
- **Test File**: sample.txt (45 lines, small outliner file)
- **Test Date**: September 14, 2025
- **Branch Comparison**: develop vs devin/1757815039-merge-reduce-duplicate-reads-optimization

## Optimization Changes Implemented
1. **File Caching System**: Added `fileContentCache` array to avoid repeated file reads
2. **Function Replacements**: 
   - Replaced `extractField` function calls with `cut` command
   - Replaced `arrayContains` function calls with `printf | grep -qx`
3. **Cached Line Access**: Uses `getCachedLines` instead of multiple `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed` operations
4. **Cache Management**: Added `loadFileCache`, `invalidateCache`, `getCachedLineCount` functions

## Performance Test Results

### Baseline Performance (develop branch)
- **Tree view (t)**: 0.081s
- **Tree view with lines (tl)**: 0.082s
- **Focus view (f)**: >61s (hung, likely performance issue)

### Optimized Performance (optimized branch)  
- **Tree view (t)**: 0.150s
- **Tree view with lines (tl)**: 0.175s
- **Focus view (f)**: Not tested (due to baseline issues)

## Performance Analysis

### Results Summary
| Operation | Baseline (develop) | Optimized | Delta | Performance Change |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Tree view (t) | 0.081s | 0.150s | +0.069s | **85% slower** |
| Tree view with lines (tl) | 0.082s | 0.175s | +0.093s | **113% slower** |

### Analysis
The optimization shows **negative performance impact** for small files like sample.txt:
- Tree view operations are 85-113% slower on the optimized branch
- The file caching overhead appears to outweigh benefits for small files
- The optimizations may be more beneficial for larger files (>1MB as mentioned in README)

### Possible Explanations
1. **Caching Overhead**: For small files, the overhead of loading content into memory arrays may exceed the benefits
2. **Function Call Changes**: The replacement of bash functions with external commands (`cut`, `grep`) may have different performance characteristics
3. **File Size Dependency**: The optimizations may only show benefits with larger files where repeated I/O operations become significant

## Recommendations
1. **Test with Larger Files**: The optimizations should be tested with 1MB+ files as specified in the README performance requirement
2. **Conditional Caching**: Consider implementing file size thresholds for when to use caching vs direct file access
3. **Benchmark Larger Datasets**: Create test files of various sizes to identify the break-even point where optimizations become beneficial

## Functional Verification
✅ Both versions produce identical output for tree operations
✅ No functional regressions detected
✅ All optimization changes successfully merged and integrated
