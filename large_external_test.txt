.	Node 1	0	
Content for node 1 with some text to make it larger and test performance.
This is additional content to simulate a larger file for performance testing.

..	Node 2	1	â˜‘
Content for node 2 with more text content.
Additional lines to make the file bigger for testing purposes.

...	Node 3	0	
Content for node 3 with even more text.
More content here to verify the optimization works with larger files.

....	Node 4	0	
Content for node 4 with substantial text content.
This helps simulate real-world usage scenarios.

.....	Node 5	1	
Content for node 5 with comprehensive text.
Testing the performance improvements with nested nodes.

......	Node 6	0	
Content for node 6 with extensive text content.
Final node to complete the test file structure.

.......	Node 7	0	
Content for node 7 with additional text.
More content to test the external process optimizations.

........	Node 8	1	
Content for node 8 with comprehensive content.
Testing deeper nesting levels for performance.

.........	Node 9	0
